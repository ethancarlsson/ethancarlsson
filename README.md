### Hi there I'm Ethan 👋

A full-stack developer with a focus on the backend at work. In my free time, I explore obscure new (sometimes esoteric) languages and write libraries and CLI programs to help developers like me. 

- ⚙️ Technology I use daily: .php, .js, .ts, .sql, .vue
- 📖 Languages that have changed the way I think about programming: Python, C, Rust, Scheme, BQN, Uiua
- 🔭 I'm working on [CLI tools](https://github.com/ethancarlsson/openapi-to-hurl), [libraries for uiua](https://github.com/ethancarlsson/assert_it.ua) and more
- 💼 I'm building public APIs and backend services at work
- 📫 How to reach me: ethanmcarlsson[at]gmail.com
